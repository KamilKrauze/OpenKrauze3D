# Open Krauze Engine
 
This is a 3D graphics engine hobby project using the OpenGL 4.5 API and GLFW.
The premise is to create a flexible and multi-platform graphics engine.

I will not provide built binaries and libraries used for you, please navigate to the [thirdparty folder](OpenKrauzeEngine/tree/main/thirdparty) for the list of libraries used.

For project generation please use [premake 5](https://premake.github.io/)
